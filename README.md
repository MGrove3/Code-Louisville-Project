Code Louisville Project

Brian,

I just wanted to thank you personally for putting all of this on for us. I can imagine how difficult it mustâ€™ve been throwing this all together with covid going on. 

So please enjoy my project, I really worked hard on this and if you can tell by my commits, it was ALOT of tinkering. So me being a designer CSS stuck with me alot more
than javascript which gave me a lot of trouble. So i have a CSS focused website. To account for some extra javascript practice I added some functions and math equations
that print to the console log as some extra java work.

directions for downloading the site
:simply download off github and place on desktop and everything else should work
:This website is photo heavy so it may take some time to download the full file

So here is what I incorporated into the website
:Use Media Queries to adjust from single column design to multi column design
:Use flexbox on multiple parts of your site to make them responsive
:Use Javascript and create a return function and use it on your site
:Create responsive header that turns into hamburger menu
:I also created a photo gallery that changes images when you hover over a thumbnail
:i also added in some extra javascript functions so i can show off some of my javascript skills

I really would love to have the opportunity to continue learning about code. While I have no intentions to becoming a coder i find this subject very interesting 
and i would love to continue to learn with Code Louisville.

Thank you!!!
Matthew Grove
